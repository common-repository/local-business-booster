Plugin to help set up and boost local businesses, improve wordpress and add extra features

== Description ==

Local Business Booster was created with the intention to help boost your local business online.
It aims to achieve this by implementing certain code and techniques to increase your chance of being index and shown on search engines.

Local Business Booster offers many features (please request others if needed) in a small package. It is targeted at small local business,
currently with 1 physical location. Getting started online can be difficult as there are many factors to take into consideration when opening your website online.

Local Business Booster main features are:

1. Uniform Business Information - From your Business name to phone number all the way to your opening hours, this information should not only be uniform throughout your website but should also throughout the web. 
2. Google Integration - Getting started with google can be intimidating the first time you set up Analytics and Search Console. Local Business Booster helps make the process easy and quick. 
3. Bing Integration - Never put all your eggs in 1 basket, an old saying that has proven true many times.  Local Business Booster makes it simple to implement Bing webmaster tools to increase your search traffic.
4. XML Sitemaps - Including a XML sitemap for your website helps google index all the pages it should. With the click of a button this can be easily done for you with Local Business Booster
5. Wordpress Features - We've included some features that make working with wordpress simpiler from searchable select boxes, blank page template, business infomation shortcodes and quick admin bar removal for your front end.
